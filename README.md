## Blind-People-Guide-cap-Head-Head-
This project aims to develop a Smart AI-Based Virtual Eye and Assistant for the visually impaired and the blind, leveraging aural feedback to provide a unique and effective means for individuals with visual impairments to "see" their surroundings. The system incorporates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enable real-time object recognition, currency identification, fire detection, color recognition, face recognition, and emotion recognition, QR\barcode decoder, as well as text reading capabilities using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Steps the run the code in Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
1) start the pc. 
2) give power to the cap using the powerbank.
3) connect the cap using the same network with the pc .
4) open vnc on the pc .
5) use vnc to display the cap os.
6) open python on the cap.
7) run the code of the cap.
8) start using the project by giving the cap an input sound then listen to the output sound.

## Hardware Requirements
1. Head-Mounted Device: The core component of the “Head Head” system is a head-mounted device that visually impaired users can wear comfortably. 
2. Camera: High-quality camera is essential for capturing visual data in real-time. The cameras should have adequate resolution and image quality to enable accurate object detection, currency recognition, color detection, face and emotion recognition, and optical character recognition (OCR).
3. Microphone: The microphone integrated into the head-mounted device capture audio input from the user.
4. Headphones: To provide aural feedback to the visually impaired users, the head-mounted device should support audio output through headphones.
5. Processing Power: we use power bank Charger for provide the needed power.
6. Connectivity: the head-mounted device may require connectivity options such as Wi-Fi to access cloud-based services. So, the raspberry pi have a Wi-Fi connection.
